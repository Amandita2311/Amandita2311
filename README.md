hi, well I'm 15 years old, my life is pretty typical adolescent shit. I like to read, I'm not so good at school, especially in math I'm terrible. I love romance books, my favorite movie and 5 steps away from you, I like to eat, I don't practice physical activity, well that makes my life shit, because most of the time I feel horrible. I like computational thinking, I find it interesting, a little complicated.
